## 📖 Abstract
This project integrates Arduino Uno with various sensors and logic ICs to implement:
- Automated lighting (cages, corridors, outdoor areas)
- Security alarm system
- Fire alarm system

The system reduces manual intervention, enhances safety, and provides a foundation for more advanced automation in correctional facilities.

## 🚀 Features
- **Prison Cage Light System** – Automatic lighting using LDR sensors.  
- **Prison Corridor Light System** – Motion-based lighting with manual override.  
- **Outdoor Light System** – Motion-activated outdoor lights.  
- **Security Alarm System** – Door-based security alerts with manual override.  
- **Fire Alarm System** – Detects smoke and temperature for early warnings.
